#OOPs Practice: Java instanceof Operator

#Coding Platform:
This solution was implemented and tested on HackerRank in the "Java OOPs" section.

###Problem Statement:
Implement a Java program demonstrating the use of the instanceof operator. You are given three classes:
-Student
-Rockstar
-Hacker

In the main method, an ArrayList is populated with instances of these classes. A count method calculates the number of instances of each class in the list and prints three integers:

The number of Student instances.
The number of Rockstar instances.
The number of Hacker instances.

#####Requirements:
Use the instanceof operator to determine the type of each object.
Modify only the necessary lines in the provided code without adding, deleting, or modifying any extra lines.
Ensure the output matches the expected format.

-Sample Input:
5
Student
Student
Rockstar
Student
Hacker

-Expected Output:
3 1 1

#####Approach:
-Class Definition:
Define three classes: Student, Rockstar, and Hacker.

-Using instanceof Operator:
Modify the missing lines to correctly count the occurrences of each class.

-Use conditional checks with instanceof to count occurrences in the count method.

-Output Verification:
Ensure that the program correctly identifies and counts instances.

Verify the output format matches the expected result.
