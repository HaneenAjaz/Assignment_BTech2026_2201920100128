# OOPs Practice: Abstract Class Implementation in Java

#Coding Platform:
This solution was implemented and tested on **HackerRank** in the "Java OOPs" section.

### Problem Statement:
Implement the following Java classes:

-An abstract class named Book with:
A String title field.
-An abstract method void setTitle(String s).
-A method String getTitle() that returns the title.
-A class named MyBook that extends the Book class and implements the setTitle method.

#### Requirements:
You must implement the setTitle method to assign the value of the title.
The MyBook class should not be public.

-The output should include:
The title is: A tale of two cities

###### Approach
1.Abstract Class Definition:
Create an abstract class Book with the required fields and methods.

2.Class Implementation:
Create a MyBook class that extends Book and implements the setTitle method.

3.Main Method:
Read input,create a MyBook instance, set the title, and print it using getTitle().
